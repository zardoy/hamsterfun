Make me this layout as on the picture using tailwindcss + react components. make sure to use flexbox and also mobile layout
A few moments: break anything into components like main blocks of the page must be in their own components. reuse shared components if possible like <Button>. And add if possible fade in or other cool appear animation using framer motion. Use placeholders for trade chart and community roles components
